# Introduction
SymbolicPPL is a graph-based probabilistic programming language that's part of the Turing ecosystem. 
The syntax of SymbolicPPL is based on [BUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/). 
The package also has the ability to run existing BUGS programs.

For now, please refer to the [Github project page](https://github.com/TuringLang/SymbolicPPL.jl) for usage information and a complete example.
