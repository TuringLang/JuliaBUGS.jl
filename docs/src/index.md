# Introduction
SymbolicPPL is a graph-based probabilistic programming language and a component of the Turing ecosystem. 
The package aims to support modelling and inference for probabilistic programs written in the [BUGS](https://www.mrc-bsu.cam.ac.uk/software/bugs/) language. 

This project is still in its very early stage, with many key components needing to be completed. 

Please refer to the [Github project page](https://github.com/TuringLang/SymbolicPPL.jl) for usage information and a complete example.
