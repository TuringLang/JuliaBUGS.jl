# Introduction

DoodleBUGS is a visual graphical model editor for building Bayesian models. It provides an intuitive drag-and-drop interface for constructing directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) that can be exported as BUGS code for inference in JuliaBUGS.

This document demonstrates how to embed the DoodleBUGS widget in a Quarto document, making it easy to create interactive tutorials and documentation.

## What are Bayesian Graphical Models?

Bayesian graphical models, also known as Bayesian networks, are a way to represent joint probability distributions using a graph structure. Each node in the graph represents a random variable, and edges represent probabilistic dependencies between variables.

The key insight is that joint distributions can often be factored into simpler conditional distributions:

$$P(X_1, X_2, ..., X_n) = \prod_{i=1}^{n} P(X_i | Pa(X_i))$$

where $Pa(X_i)$ denotes the parent nodes of $X_i$ in the graph.

## Interactive Model Builder

Below is an embedded DoodleBUGS widget. You can use it to:

- **Add nodes** using the toolbar (stochastic, deterministic, constant, observed)
- **Create edges** by connecting nodes to represent dependencies
- **Organize models** using plates for repeated structures
- **Export BUGS code** that can be used with JuliaBUGS

## Example: Simple Linear Regression

A simple Bayesian linear regression model can be specified as:

$$y_i \sim \text{Normal}(\alpha + \beta x_i, \tau)$$

where:

- $\alpha$ is the intercept
- $\beta$ is the slope coefficient  
- $\tau$ is the precision (inverse variance)

Try building this model in the widget above! You'll need:

1. A **constant** node for $x$
2. **Stochastic** nodes for $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\tau$ (with appropriate priors)
3. An **observed** node for $y$
4. Edges connecting the parameters to $y$

## Using the Generated Code

Once you've built your model, you can export the BUGS code and use it with JuliaBUGS:

```julia
using JuliaBUGS

# Paste your generated BUGS model here
model_code = """
model {
    # Your model specification
}
"""

# Compile and run inference
model = compile(model_code, data)
samples = sample(model, NUTS(), 1000)
```

## Conclusion

DoodleBUGS makes it easy to visualize and build Bayesian models interactively. Combined with Quarto documents, you can create engaging tutorials that let readers experiment with models directly in the browser.
