# Overview

This document details the investigation and improvement of JuliaBUGS' log density evaluation performance. The investigation:

1. Establishes baseline performance with a hand-written implementation
2. Analyzes current performance bottlenecks
3. Explores solutions using `FunctionWrappers.jl`

Each chapter represents a step in this investigation, with code examples and benchmarks to illustrate the findings.

:::{.callout-note}
All benchmarks were run on the `rats` model from Volume 1 of BUGS examples.
