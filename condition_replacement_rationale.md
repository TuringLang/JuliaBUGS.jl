# Condition Function Replacement Rationale

## Why Replace the Old Implementation

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- **Old**: Mixed graph operations (Markov blanket computation) with conditioning logic in a single function
- **New**: Clear separation - `mark_as_observed`, `update_evaluation_env`, and subgraph creation are separate functions

### 2. **Code Duplication**
- **Old**: Had two `condition` functions with overlapping logic
- **New**: Single main function with helper for parsing different input types

### 3. **Better Markov Blanket Implementation**
- **Old**: Uses `markov_blanket` which only finds immediate stochastic boundaries
- **New**: Uses `_markov_blanket` which correctly handles deterministic nodes along paths

### 4. **Cleaner Code Structure**
- **Old**: Complex nested conditionals and inline operations
- **New**: Modular helper functions that are easier to test and understand

### 5. **Maintainability**
- **Old**: Hard to modify without affecting multiple parts
- **New**: Each function has a single responsibility, making changes safer

## Key Changes

1. **Removed `deepcopy`**: Not needed, using BangBang operations instead
2. **Simplified sorted_nodes logic**: Now integrated into main flow
3. **Better input handling**: `parse_conditioning_spec` handles all input types uniformly
4. **Proper graph updates**: `mark_as_observed` ensures consistency
5. **Using `_markov_blanket`**: More comprehensive Markov blanket computation

## Backward Compatibility

The new implementation maintains the same external API:
- `condition(model, dict)` - still works
- `condition(model, dict, sorted_nodes)` - still works (sorted_nodes ignored)
- `condition(model, vector, env)` - replaced by cleaner parsing

## Testing

All existing tests should pass with minimal modifications:
- Update imports to include `_markov_blanket`
- The behavior remains the same from user perspective
- Internal implementation is cleaner and more maintainable
