# R Interface

Interoperation between Julia and R is very solid and simple to use.

Here are some very useful packages:

- [`RCall.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaInterop/RCall.jl): interaction with R runtime.
- [`RData.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaData/RData.jl): reading and writing R data files.
- [`DataFrames.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaData/DataFrames.jl): `pandas` and `dplyr` for Julia.
- [`CSV.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaData/CSV.jl): CSV file reading and writing.
- [`JSON.jl`](https://github.com/JuliaIO/JSON.jl), [`JSON3.jl`](https://github.com/quinnj/JSON3.jl), [`Serde.jl`](https://github.com/bhftbootcamp/Serde.jl): JSON file reading and writing.
