## Panic Mode

# Instead of giving up, we can enter the recovery(panic) mode, find a rendezvous(synchronization) 
# point, and continue parsing. 
# The implementation is not necessarily straightforward because sometimes we are in a deep call stack. 
# One possible way to implement it is using exception handling.

# Notes on the attempt to implement `panic mode`:
# - What I tried
#   - Throw an error when we detect that the `current_pos` is not moving
#     forward. This is implemented implicitly in the `add_diagnostic!` function --
#     when two diagnostics are added with the same `current_pos`, then we throw an error.
#   - My plan was that instead of throwing an error, we could enter panic mode
#     and try to recover.
#   - Conceptually, recovery is simple: We need to skip tokens until a
#     synchronization point is found, and then dispatch to the corresponding
#     `process_` function.
#   - The issue is rooted in the mutual recursive nature of the program. When we
#     throw an exception, we are in a deep call stack, so reentry to the previous
#     function requires some thought.
#   - **After some thinking**, a monolithic recovery may not be the best idea;
#     we should put try-catch in
#     - `process_for`: Wrap `process_statements!` so we have a chance to return
#       to the for loop to wrap it up.
#     - `process_statements!`: Wrap the while loop body.
#   - The point is that the recovery requirements are different for different
#     functions, so we should put the try-catch in the functions themselves.

## State Syncing
# Recursive descent parser can be viewed as a state machine. We can try to sync up the parsing state and continue parsing. 
# Some thoughts:
# - Singular error
#     - Misspell
#         - The misspelled word is parsed into a single token
#             - The right thing to do is record the diagnostic and discard and continue parsing
#             - Reliable detection is difficult, especially since misspelled words can be parsed into multiple tokens, 
#                   so simply checking the next token is not enough, but it might be a good enough heuristic
#         - The misspelled word is parsed into multiple tokens
#             - The right thing, in this case, is to skip all the tokens birthed by the misspelled word and continue parsing
#             - This might not be that bad because we whitelist the tokens that can be parsed into multiple tokens
#     - Missing
#         - the right thing to do is just continue without consuming or discarding
#     - Extra
#         - the right thing is to discard until the start of the next state
# - Consecutive errors
#     - This can be tricky because the detection is very difficult in the worst case. If we have a state syncing
#           function for every state, and the lookahead length is 2, then we can match the "next token" enter the 
#           next state, and then try to sync again in that state.
function sync_state(ps::ProcessState, current_token::String, next_token::Tuple)
    if peek_raw(ps) == current_token && peek_raw(ps, 2) in next_token
        return nothing
    elseif peek_raw(ps) == current_token ## peek_raw(ps, 2) != next_token
    # start an error diagnostic
    # then we seek till one of the next_token is found
    # if not found anything in the given budget, add to the diagnostic
    # add a special place_holder and move on
    elseif peek_raw(ps, 2) == next_token # peek_raw(ps) != current_token
    else
